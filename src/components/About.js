          Bandarban Hill District is the most remote and least populated
          district in Bangladesh. The lure of the tallest peaks of Bangladesh,
          treks through virgin forests and chance to meet more than 15 tribes of
          the region up close is growing both among Bangladeshis and tourists
          from other countries. Since the insurgency ceased in the Chittagong
          Hill Tracts (a cluster that includes all three hill districts of
          Bangladesh) it has opened up for tourists more than a decade back,
          though some of the western tourist guides may still describe the area
          as a major security risk.It is governed by a Hill Council under the
          Bangladesh government, headed by the King of Mong Circle. The current
          monarch, His Highness King Aung Shue Prue Chowdhury, is the 15th to
          sit on the throne. The front hall (Raj Durbar) of the Royal Palace is
          open to visitors, provided that appropriate behavior is maintained.
          Interestingly the 13th Royal Family claims the current Family to be
          usurpers to the throne. Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, Hindu, and
          Chramma are major religions along with many pagan faiths. The best
          place for information are the Press Club (phone: +880 (0) 361 62549),
          the Tribal Cultural Institute (phone: +880 (0) 361 62424), the office
          of Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, the government owned tourism
          company and the office of Guide Tours, the largest privately owned
          tourism company, at Hill Side Resort. Bandarban, a 4,479 kmÂ² wide area
          with a population of 292,900 (2003 est.) inside Bangladesh is bordered
          by Cox's Bazaar, Chittagong, Rangamati and Khagrachari. On the other
          side of the 129 kilometre international border lies Myanmar provinces
          of Chin and Arakan. Bandarban has only one town that approaches
          anything near a city - the Bandarban town. The rest of the area is
          divided into 7 upazilas, which are in turn divided into varying
          numbers of unions. Each union is a cluster of paras and villages.

          Galengga, Pyndu, Remakree Pranksha In the early days of 15th century,
          Arakanese kingdom expended its territories to the Chittagong area of
          Bengal. After the victory of Arakan on Burma's Pegu kingdom in 1599
          AD, the Arakanese king Mong Raja Gree appointed a Prince of Pegu as
          the governor of newly established Bohmong Htaung (Circle) by giving
          the title of "Bohmong" Raja. That area was mostly populated by the
          Arakanese descendants and ruled by the Burmese (Myanmar) noble
          descendants who started to call themselves in Arakanese language as
          Marma. Marma is an archaic Arakanese pronunciation for Myanmar. As the
          population of the Bohmong Htaung were of Arakanese descandants, these
          Myanmar-desendants Bohmong chiefs (Rajas) of the ruling class took the
          titles in Arakanese and speak a dialect of the Arakanese language.
          Bandarban Hill District was once called Bohmong Htaung since the
          Arakanese rule. Once Bohmong Htaung was ruled by Bohmong Rajas who
          were the subordinates to the Arakanese kings. Ancestors of the present
          Bohmong dynasty were the successor of the Pegu King of Burma under the
          Arakan's rule in Chittagong. In 1614, King Mong Kha Maung, the king of
          Arakan appointed Maung Saw Pru as Governor of Chittagong who in 1620
          repulsed the Portuguese invasion with great valour. As a consequence,
          Arakanese king, Mong Kha Maung adorned Maung Saw Pru with a title of
          Bohmong meaning Great General. After the death of Maung Saw Pru two
          successors retained Bohmong title. During the time of Bohmong Hari
          Gneo in 1710, Arakanese King Canda Wizaya recaptured Chittagong from
          the Mughals. Bohmong Hari Gneo helped King Canda Wizaya in recapturing
          Chittagong and as a mark of gratitude the later conferred on Bohmong
          Hari Gneo the grand title of Bohmong Gree which means great Commander
          in Chief. During the British Raj, it was declared as the Bohmong
          circle with limited autonomy. The Mizokaba or the Mizo uprise in the
          mid 19th century was major catalyst for re-settlemet of the tribes in
          the area. During World War II the area saw the presence of a
          formidable British military presence that came to stand against a
          Japanese invasion. The tribes of these hills held the reputation of
          unyielding rebellion throughout history. When India, Pakistan and
          Mynamar went independent from the Raj, the leaders of the tribes
          people decided unsuccessfully to become a part of Mynamar, then known
          as Burma. During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 to gain
          independence from Pakistan, the leaders again sought unsuccessfully to
          remain a part of Pakistan. In the late 1970s, a policy of forced
          settlement of Bengalis into hills was pursued, which later gave rise
          to much violence against the hill people and the insurgency led by
          Shanti Bahini, the military wing of Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati
          Samiti. There have been an attempt to create divide among tribal
          cultural lines between the Chakmas, who led Shantibanhini, and the
          Mrus, by creating an anti-Shantibanhini militia out of them. Now,
          after the peace treaty, Bandarban stands as a locally governed ethnic
          region together with the two other hill districts. Representation of
          numerous tribes of the district in the Hill Council now stands as a
          thorn of dispute here.
